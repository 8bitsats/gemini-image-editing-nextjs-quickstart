❌ Copyrighted characters (Disney, Marvel, etc.)
❌ Hate symbols or discriminatory content
```

#### **"Technical Error" / "Generation Failed"**
```
Problem: Server-side processing error
Solutions:
  1. Try the exact same prompt again (often works)
  2. Slightly modify the prompt and retry
  3. Switch to different generation type temporarily
  4. Clear browser cache and retry
  5. Check platform status page
  6. Wait 10-15 minutes and try again
```

Solutions:
  1. Check prompt length (max 2000 characters)
  2. Remove special characters or emojis
  3. For image uploads:
     - Max file size: 10MB
     - Supported formats: JPEG, PNG, WebP
     - Check image isn't corrupted
  4. For document uploads:
     - PDF files only
     - Max size: 50MB
     - Not password protected
```

### 🎨 **Poor Quality Results**

**Improving Generation Quality**:

🎨 Style Descriptors:
✅ "photorealistic", "digital art", "oil painting", "sketch"
✅ "cinematic lighting", "golden hour", "studio lighting"
✅ "high detail", "professional quality", "artistic composition"

📐 Technical Parameters:
✅ "16:9 aspect ratio", "portrait orientation"
✅ "close-up", "wide shot", "aerial view"
✅ "shallow depth of field", "bokeh background"
```

#### **Iteration Strategies**:
```
🔄 Progressive Refinement:
1. Start with basic prompt
2. Generate initial result
3. Add specific improvements: "make it more colorful"
4. Build on successful elements
5. Use conversation history for context

🎛️ Parameter Adjustment:
